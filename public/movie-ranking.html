<h1>The Best Movies of All Time According to Ken</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>The Godfather</h3>
<p>Yes, it's violent. Yes, they're criminals, but the movie is as much about family as it is crime</p>
<h3>The Sting</h3>
<p>A great story with great characters and one of the best endings ever.</p>
<h3>Casablanca</h3>
<p>It's a war movie, it's a love story... there's something for everyone.</p>
